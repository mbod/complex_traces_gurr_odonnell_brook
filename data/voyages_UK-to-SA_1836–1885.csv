The ship lay at Schnapper Point until 5/4/1850, with the emigrants housed in tents on Torrens Island, while the ship was fumigated. According to ""The Adelaide Times,"" Monday April 1 1850 No. 109, Vol II Page 2 Column e: ""The following deaths took place on board the Trafalgar: Stephen Thomas, exhaustion consequent on sea sickness; Emma Leason, dysentery; George Green, ditto; Owen Zurau, eating part of a blister which had been applied to the nape of his neck; Mary Sheridan, hooping cough; Leason (infant), inanition; Smith�s infant, premature birth; Ann Mansbridge, diarrhae; P. Corrigan, hooping cough, Elizabeth Hayman, do; Thomas Box, ditto; Eliza Gallienci ditto; Ellen Howell, ditto; Webday�s infant, inanition; Marshall, premature birth; Caroline Webday, dysentery; A. Oldroyd, typhus fever. Fourteen of the above are young children"" One can imagine a mother�s dilemma confined below decks with young children in the stagnant space, with the contagious whooping cough, dysentery and typhus on board. Inanition is starvation from lack of food and the intense heat crossing the equator could have lead to the death from diarrhea.

Strathern,1850,1.0,155.0,,,London & Tor Bay,Port Adelaide,,,,,"The barque STRATHEDEN, Captain Turner, which arrived in these waters on Friday last, was, it seems, ""cursed with another ""type of the class"" known as medical drunkards, who seem to flock to these shores as if to a congenial clime. The individual who has earned for himself a niche in our editorial portrait gallery of mad doctors, flaring-up skippers and debauchee officers, rejoices in the name of Benyon, and appears to have distinguished himself by unusual depravity on ship-board.

The medical chest, with its phials and fittings, were it is true, at the service of the sick, but the unsteady hand and intoxicated brain of the wretched sot who should have administered the physic and medicaments, were unfit to compound the one, or apply the other; and had it not been for the fortunate presence of a passenger doctor, there is no knowing what fatal consequences might have resulted. Under the influence of some singular hallucination, Dr Benyon appears to have supposed that the medical comforts were put on board for his own use. At all events he prescribed them for himself and most scrupulously (or rather unscrupulously) followed the prescription.

For gross obscenity in the cabin whilst under the influence of strong drink, the unworthy doctor of the STRATHEDEN was banished from the cabin by the commander [captain] and he even so far forgot himself as to challenge the chief officer to a pugilistic encounter. But as these repeated instances of Dr Benyon's drunkenness, brawling and dissipation are duly recorded in the ship's log, and will probably become the subject of formal complaint by the captain, we shall not dwell further upon the circumstances, although so odious and so hazardous to the health and lives of nearly two hundred passengers.""",https://bound-for-south-australia.collections.slsa.sa.gov.au/1850Stratheden.htm     https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/38448907,0.6451612903225806,154.0

The ""John Bunyan"" arrived from Liverpool on the 22d May 1854, after a passage of 100 days ; bringing to the colony 318 souls ; 29 deaths and four births took place at sea. The great mortality in this ship was caused by measles and scarlet fever, both of which broke out within four days after the ship left Liverpool. These diseases appeared first among the single women, and went right through the ship to the forecastle amongst the sailors. When the ship arrived the disease had ceased, and the general health was very good. The surgeon-superintendent appears to have experienced some difficulty in managing the single women, a few of whom were not well-behaved. In consequence of irregularities occuring in the evening he was obliged to diminish the number of lights which are usually allowed ; this caused some dissatisfaction, but, from the circumstances, he was quite justified in the mode of punishment which he adopted. It is to be regretted that, on this occasion, the innocent were put to inconvenience on account of the ill-behaved.","The South Australian Government Gazette 1866 p. 85

From Southampton, arrived on the 14th of March after a passage of 99 days with 307 immigrants. Four births and twelve deaths occurred at sea and before disembarkation. Much discontent prevailed on board amongst the immigrants, which made it necessary for the Immigration Board to investigate the nature and causes of the complaints. It appeared that there had been, during the voyage a lamentable want of cooperation between the master and surgeon of the ship. The immigrants generally complained of an insufficient supply of lamps. It appeared on inquiry that on leaving England and for some time after, eighteen lamps were lighted at dark in the part of the ship appropriated to the immigrants, but it was shown that the Surgeon-Superintendent had not taken the precaution of having any of these extinguished at bedtime; and when the master of the ship went below on two occasions to see that all was safe, he found all the lamps lighted after midnight. On the first occasion he spoke to the Surgeon, who did not rectify the evil ; and, considering that such a state of things, if permitted to continue, would seriously endanger the safety of all on board, he took upon himself to limit the number of lamps lighted at sunset to five amongst the immigrants, one in the hospital and one in the matrons room.
On this occasion the Board could not blame the master for interfering when the Surgeon so far neglected his duty. —
“ Had the surgeon superintendent been un-blameable in his own conduct, we should have viewed with less distrust his charges against the Captain ; but it is most clearly shown, that the surgeon superintendent was discovered after the usual hours of retiring to rest, sitting in the pantry with the steward, drinking wine which had been brought from the hospital stores. It is also clearly proved that the Surgeon allowed the boatswain to frequent the young womens' apartments in the evening, under the pretence that he was in love with and about to marry one of the single girls. Such behaviour in a Surgeon-Superintendent cannot be too strongly condemned ; it tends to undermine all regularity and order, and to introduce insubordination and confusion.”   The South Australian Government Gazette 1866 p. 84",,3.9215686274509802,294.0

The ""Time and Truth"" arrived from Plymouth on the 8th of May, after a passage of 118 days; bringing to the colony 239 souls; six deaths and four births took place during the voyage. This vessel arrived in very excellent order. The fresh potatoes which were put on board at Plymouth were found after 12 days to be unsound, so that there was not a sufficient supply of preserved potatoes to last the voyage ; in other respects, the provisions and water were abundant and good. The surgeon-superintendent suggests that an addition should be made to the quantity of the Sp. AEth. Nitric. put on board under the charter-party; I have had no complaint made on this head by other any surgeon. [sic]","BPP 1854-55 (42) Papers relative to Emigration to Australian Colonies part I.

Arrived from Plymouth on the 23rd October, having been 99 days at sea. Six births and four deaths occurred at sea, and 372 souls were landed in the Colony.
It was very evident at the first visit to the ship, that the surgeon-superintendent was totally unfitted for such a charge, and could not maintain regularity or discipline. No complaints, however, were made either against the surgeon or the officers of the ship, with the exception of a charge made by the surgeon-superintendent against the chief officer for familiarity with one of the single girls. However, on a perusal of the surgeon’s journal, charges of such a serious character were there entered against the master and officers of the ship, that it was considered necessary that these circumstances should be carefully investigated. The Immigration Board sat three successive days investigating the matter, when it appeared to them, with the exception of a complaint against the first officer, that all the other grave charges in the surgeon’s journal were utterly devoid of fact and without foundation. The charge against the first mate, otherwise a very efficient officer, was considered to be proved in so far as he had paid marked attention to one of the single girls. It was clearly shown that these attentions were with the entire concurrence of the father and mother of the young woman, were honorable in their motive, and devoid of the slightest approach to indecorum. The board were of opinion that such intimacies of the officers with the single women should not be allowed to exist on board ship ; as they tended to show a bad example to the crew, and were otherwise calculated to undermine the discipline, and interfere with the authority of the surgeon-superintendent.
The Board gave it as their opinion, that had it not been for the energy of the master and officers of the Lord Raglan, that the surgeon could not have maintained anything like discipline on board ; that he was quite unfit to manage an emigrant ship, and that he ought not to be again entrusted with such a charge. His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor was pleased so far to approve the Report of the Immigration Board, (a copy of which His Excellency directed to be sent to the Commissioners), and at the same time to represent to them the advisableness of making known to all officers of emigrant ships, that a penalty will be attached to them if they pay particular attention to any female emigrant on board, even though such attentions may be perfectly innocent.",,1.0752688172043012,368.0

The Pestongee Bomanjee arrived from Southampton on the 7th October, having made the voyage in 112 days ; 303 souls were landed. Five births and ten deaths were the casualties during the voyage. Fever to a considerable extent prevailed during the voyage. It seems to me that cleanliness had not been sufficiently enforced ; and I have little doubt that the prevalence, if not the origin of the sickness, was caused by that neglect. In all other respects the surgeon-superintendent used every means to promote the comfort and health of the people, so that there is little doubt that his want of experience in the management of emigrants was the cause of the laxity of discipline at first; which, during the voyage, he found it difficult if not impossible to rectify. The stoppage of the certificate for return passage money to England, was considered as a sufficient warning to him to act with more decision if he were again entrusted with the charge of an emigrant ship ; as his Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor was pleased to approve this recommendation, and to order that the certificate should be withheld.
